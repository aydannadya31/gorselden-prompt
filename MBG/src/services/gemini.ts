        contents: `Generate a high-end 4K fashion photography description for an exclusive editorial archive.
        
        MANDATORY COLOUR PHILOSOPHY: The output image MUST feature extremely vibrant, colorful, and multi-colored elements. Avoid dull greys, monochromatic blacks, or muted tones. Incorporate rich, highly saturated hues, vivid neon highlights, glowing gradients, or color-blocked combinations (such as striking cobalt, blazing orange, hot pink, emerald green, and deep royal violet) to make the photograph incredibly lively and dramatic.
        
        MANDATORY SUBJECT: Female model specified as: ${selectedModelType}.
        OUTFIT STYLE CATEGORY: ${selectedOutfit.category}.
        OUTFIT STYLE REQUIREMENT: ${selectedOutfit.description}.
        
        STRICT ENVIRONMENT & EXCLUSION RULES (CRITICAL):
        - The image background and scene MUST STRICTLY be OUTDOOR, OPEN-AIR, or SEMI-OPEN architectural luxury terrace environments.
        - Absolutely INDOOR scenes, enclosing walls, building interiors, store interiors, or closed-off hallways are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
        - Ensure active background vistas such as sparkling sea horizons, gorgeous towering trees, or grand cityscapes under natural skies.
        
        ADDITIONAL MANDATORY DETAILS FOR THE IMAGED OUTFIT:
        - Must strictly include a daring low-cut/cleavage/backless detail (dekolte).
        - Must strictly include a deep, attractive thigh-high slit (derin yırtmaç) showing leg movement in the pose.
        - Ensure extreme outfit diversity and uniqueness: every dress or garment design MUST feature completely original structural attributes, avant-garde tailoring details, varying geometric cutouts, asymmetric hemlines, distinctive collar types, diverse sleeve concepts (e.g. dramatic bishop sleeves, structured high-capped shoulders, extreme bell flares, asymmetrical single-shoulder wraps, or bold halter designs), custom metallic ornaments, or complex layered drapery. Absolutely avoid repeating basic silhouettes. Each design must look like a unique, bespoke haute couture masterpiece.
        - Ensure great variety in hairstyles, ethnicity, facial geometry, and high-quality photography set surroundings.
        
        PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT & SCENE INTERACTION RULES (MANDATORY FOR NATURAL REALISM):
        - The model and her outfit MUST physically interact with the environment:
          1. Wind & Motion: If the background is airy or outdoors, describe how the wind dynamically sweeps her hair strands and billows/drags the light fabrics (silk/chiffon) to show natural aerodynamic tension and movement.
          2. Light Caustics & Reflection Bounces: Ambient lighting from the scenery must cast colored reflections (rim light/bounce light) on her skin and dress. If there is water, marble, or metallic surfaces nearby, specify ray-traced reflections, shimmering ripple caustics, and soft ambient occlusion shadows beneath her heels.
          3. Tactile Contact & Gravity: Describe the clothing bowing to gravity, creating realistic folds or wrinkles at joints (elbows, waist, knees) and showing genuine weight, stretch, and fabric friction against her body.
          4. Surface Interaction: The model should touch her surroundings, or have her weight realistically balanced on modern chairs, rocky shorelines, elegant stairs, or yachts, creating real shadow contact points to prevent a "photoshopped" or floating look.
        
        ULTRA-REALISTIC HUMAN TEXTURES (ANTI-AI-SLOP DIRECTIVES):
        - Absolutely NO airbrushed, plastic, or doll-like skins.
        - Mandate micro-textures: real skin pore visibility under high-end studio lenses, delicate goosebumps, tiny birthmarks, fine peach fuzz on the cheeks in backlit conditions, realistic muscle definition, and a natural non-greasy skin glow or satin sweat sheen.
        - Hair must exhibit individual random flyaway strands, natural roots, and dimensional volume instead of flat solid helmet shapes.
        
        Contextual Elements: ${selectedEnv}, ${selectedLight}, ${selectedComp}, ${selectedFabric}, ${selectedTrend}.
        
        PROMPT ENGINEERING DIRECTIVES (for "imagePrompt"):
        The output MUST be a technical, hyper-detailed prompt designed for high-end AI image generators (8K, RAW, realistic). 
        You MUST use the following EXACT structural format in the "imagePrompt":
        
        PART 1: [MODEL SPECIFICATIONS]
        (Describe in extreme detail: Facial geometry, authentic skin macro-textures, pore definition, lifelike catchlights in her eyes, exact hair strand behavior with flyaways, and professional editorial posture matching the chosen model profile. Reference how her gaze connects with the camera lens naturally).
        
        PART 2: [GARMENT & COUTURE SPECIFICATIONS]
        (Describe in extreme detail: The piece's custom construction of category "${selectedOutfit.category}", complex fabric weight and tactile weave texture of ${selectedFabric}, rich vibrant multi-colored fabric colors, how the light interacts with the material via specular highlights, micro-fold stress lines, visible premium stitching, and the precise silhouette interaction with the model's form. Highlight BOTH the daring decollete/cleavage AND the thigh-high side slit to expose athletic legs. Emphasize a color palette designed to pop off the screen).
        
        PART 3: [ENVIRONMENT & LIGHTING]
        (Detailed architectural lighting, real-world physics, and environmental atmosphere of: ${selectedEnv}. Integrate the specific lighting style "${selectedLight}" causing realistic light bounces on the model, casting soft natural diffusion, and projecting dramatic ambient shadows on the surrounding textures to bind the scene as a single cohesive frame).
        
        PART 4: [TECHNICAL PARAMETERS]
        (Technical photography equipment and settings: "Shot on Hasselblad H6D-100c, 85mm lens, f/2.8 aperture, cinematic soft focus, razor-sharp focus on the eyes, warm editorial color grading, natural film grain, realistic exposure, hyper-realistic volumetric raytraced lighting").
        
        PART 5: [CONSISTENCY & QUALITY]
        (Append the EXACT quality control text below here).
  
        QUALITY CONTROL TEXT (MANDATORY APPEND): 
        "The faces of the models should not change or deteriorate; their faces must be preserved in every shooting angle. No anatomical deterioration should occur. Any potential deterioration must be pre-checked and corrected, and it should not prevent the formation of the prompt."
  
        OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
        1. "imagePrompt": A MASTERPIECE-level, structured technical prompt as described above. (ALWAYS IN ENGLISH).
        2. "displayDescription": A sophisticated, poetic editorial description of the piece and its aesthetic narrative in ${targetLang}. Describe the specific category (${selectedOutfit.category}) and how the elegant cleavage (dekolte) and thigh-slit (yırtmaç) define its modern form. Detail the bright colors and colorful narrative of the look.`,
